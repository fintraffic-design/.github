# Fintraffic Design

## 🙋‍♀️ Introduction

This Github organization is the home of Fintraffic Design System and related repositories for building the Fintraffic Experience.

## 🌈 Contribution guidelines

### Contributing as a designer

When you start designing a new feature, you will likely encounter scenarios where the Fintraffic Design System does not provide everything you need. You are welcome to make the required changes or additions yourself, or if needed, you can request changes from others in the Fintraffic Design System community.

The Fintraffic Core UI library in Figma is the main source of truth for things regarding Fintraffic Design System. All changes and change requests are handled using Figma branching. Changes must be sent to the design system team for review before they can be merged to the main library

### Contributing as a developer

Fintraffic Design System's developer libraries and tooling are currently under development. So far we've published our Design Tokens as CSS and SCSS variables. We're planning on releasing a CSS framework for Fintraffic Design System and further down the line build a web component library out of the Design System components.

You're welcome to make pull requests if you see any bugs you can fix or want to help us develop the future building blocks of the Fintraffic Experience.
